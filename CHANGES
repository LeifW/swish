0.3.1.1:

  - N3 I/O: 

    - strings ending in a double-quote character are now written out
      correctly.

    - xsd:double values are not written using XSD canonical
      form/capital E but with using a lower-case exponent.

    - in input, xsd:double literals are converted to XSD canonical
      form (as stored in 'RDFLabel'), which can make simple textual
      comparison of literals fail.

  - RDFLabel:

    - the Eq instance now ignores the case of the language tag for
      literals

    - the Show instance uses the XSD canonical form for xsd:boolean,
      xsd:integer, xsd:decimal and xsd:double literals. 

  - The ToRDFLable and FromRDFLabel classes replicate
    existing functionality in Swish.RDF.RDFDatatype; this should
    be cleaned up.

0.3.1.0:

  - NSGraph:

    - added Monoid instance with a Label constraint.

  - RDFLabel:

    - added IsString instance.

    - added ToRDFLabel and FromRDFLabel type classes for converting to
      and from RDFLabel along with instances for some standard Haskell
      types.

  - RDFTriple:

    - added toRDFTriple and fromRDFTriple functions that take advantage
      of the To/FromRDFLabel typeclasses to ease conversion from/to Arcs.

  - QName and ScopedName:

    - added IsString instance.

  - UTCTime support (To/FromRDFLabel) has required adding old-locale
    and time to the package constraints.

  - added xsd_dateTime export to Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.

  - added Swish and Swish.RDF modules for documentation purposes.

  - marked Swish.Utils.DateTime as deprecated.

  - the N3 formatter now writes true, 1, 1.2, 1.2e34 rather than
    "true"^^xsd:boolean, "1"^^xsd:integer, "1.2"^^xsd:decimal
    and "1.2e34"^^xsd:double.

  - improved test coverage.

0.3.0.3:

  - changed scripts/SwishExample.ss script so that the proof succeeds.

  - minor documentation improvements, including the addition of the
    Swish script format in Swish.RDF.SwishScript.

  - minor changes to behavior of Swish in several edge cases.

0.3.0.2:

  - bugfix: stop losing triples with a bnode subject when using the
    N3 Formatter which also makes the scripts/SwishTest.ss script run
    successfully.

  - several commands in Swish scripts now create screen
    output as an aid to debugging.

  - added the developer flag.

0.3.0.1:

  - updated the Swish script parser to work with the changes in
    0.3.0.0 (reported by Rick Murphy).

  - several example scripts are installed in the scripts/ directory,
    although only VehicleCapacity.ss works with this release.

0.2.1 to 0.3.0.0:

  - Renamed module hierarchy from

      Swish.HaskellRDF.*
      Swish.HaskellUtils.*

    to

      Swish.RDF.*
      Swish.Utils.*

  - removed modules, either because un-needed or replaced
    by other libraries:

    *) replaced with Data.Traversable instances

      Swish.HaskellUtils.FunctorM

    *) replaced with routines from Network.URI

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ProcessURI
      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParseURI

    *) copy of a Parsec module

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParsecLanguage

    *) Replaced with Data.List.sort as only used the 
       stableQuickSort routine

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Sort.*

    *) Replaced use with simple parsec parser

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Dfa.Dfa

    *) Replaced with 'Either String'

      Swish.HaskellUtils.ErrorM

    *) Un-needed 

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Parse
      Swish.HaskelUtils.AccumulateM
      Swish.HaskellUtils.TestHelpers

  - removed Either String instance from ErrorM

  - should now compile with mtl-2

  - added upper and lower bounds to package dependencies

  - a number of Test executables have been removed, either
    because of a removed module or missing data files.

  - updated Haddock documentation to build

  - added the following flags

      tests   - compile tests or not?
      hpc     - compile tests with -hpc?

  - support for the NTriples format has been added (e.g. the -nt
    flag in Swish)

  - the N3 parser and formatter have been re-written to better
    match the latest specification. Some previously valid N3 files
    will likely no-linger parse since support for constructs like
    'this' and ':-' have been removed.

    The N3 parser does not handle @forAll statements and ignores any
    @forSome statements. It is also slower than the original parser.

    The formatter has been updated to make better use of the '[]', 
    '()' and '{}' syntactic short cuts.

    Strings containing "unexpected" escape combinations - such as \a -
    may not be handled correctluy.

  - change in behavior of Swish command-line tool when given
    invalid arguments as it now errors out if given an invalid
    argument before processing any input.
