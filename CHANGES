0.2.1 to 0.3.0.0:

  - removed modules, wither because un-needed or replaced
    by other libraries:

    *) replaced with Data.Traversable instances

      Swish.HaskellUtils.FunctorM

    *) replaced with routines from Network.URI

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ProcessURI
      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParseURI

    *) copy of a Parsec module

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParsecLanguage

    *) Un-needed 

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Parse

  - Swish.HaskellRDF.Sort modules are now hidden (and most of
    them have been removed since they were unused)

  - updated Haddock documentation to build

  - removed Either String instance from ErrorM

  - should now compile with mtl-2

  - added upper and lower bounds to package dependencies

  - a number of Test executables have been removed, either
    because of a removed module or missing data files.
