parser-update branch

  - updating the N3 Parser to better match the latest specification;
    this is not backwards compatible with the syntax supported by
    Swish in version 0.2.1 (e.g. no ":-"), so there are a number
    of changes to the test suite

  - the new specification is not fully supported yet; in particular

    - @keywords, @forSome, @forAll are not supported

    - string literals are not parsed correctly, embarassingly enough

    - the N3 Formatter hasn't yet been updated to match the new
      syntax, in particular the output may include use of the
      now-removed :- symbol.

    - the test suite has been cleaned to pass with the new code but
      it has not been re-worked or extended to properly test the new
      parser

    - the parser is *significantly* slower than the old version

  - I plan to move to using Text rather than String, which will mean
    changing from Parsec to attoparsec-text (probably).

Thoughts:

  - need to remove the use of :- in N3Formatter; should probably aim to
    create turtle-compatible output where possible, with flags to control
    the use of existential statements (@forSome), a la cwm

0.2.1 to 0.3.0.0:

  - removed modules, wither because un-needed or replaced
    by other libraries:

    *) replaced with Data.Traversable instances

      Swish.HaskellUtils.FunctorM

    *) replaced with routines from Network.URI

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ProcessURI
      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParseURI

    *) copy of a Parsec module

      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParsecLanguage

    *) Un-needed 

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Parse
      Swish.HaskelUtils.AccumulateM

    *) Either un-needed or now hidden

      Swish.HaskellRDF.Sort.*

  - removed Either String instance from ErrorM

  - should now compile with mtl-2

  - added upper and lower bounds to package dependencies

  - a number of Test executables have been removed, either
    because of a removed module or missing data files.

  - updated Haddock documentation to build
