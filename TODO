Some things I want to/should do (not in order)

- use types better - e.g. ScopedName/Namespace has a lot of String
  entries which could be replaced by Maybe String and URI

  Should there be a type-level constaint that an RDF Arc can only have
  a literal in the object position?

- the RDFLabel data type could be split up to add additional type
  constraints, namely Lit could be split up into something like ULit
  for an untyped literal, LLit for a language lit coupled with a
  LString type that combines text and language tag), and DLit for a
  literal with a datatype. This would require a minor version update

  An alternative change would be to make it 'Lit RDFLiteral' with
  RDFLiteral having the Untyped/Typed/Language options.

- remove parsec parser, replace by attoparsec-text

  - use Text rather than String
  - use attoparsec-text-enumerator?

  This would require a minor version update

- move a lot of parser/formatter tests out to ntriples files (ie the
  test data in external files).

- turtle parser, then RDF/XML.

- look at using fgl rather than existing graph code (may or may not be
  worth it), especially given that it's not really a graph

- look at using something like a TextBuilder for processing output

- profile (have added the -fdeveloper cabal flag which can be combined
  with the --enable-library-profiling and --enable-executable-profiling
  flags)

- improve test coverage (-fhpc cabal flag)

- how much of the support code - e.g. Swish.Utils.LookupMap - can now
  be replaced with packages from hackage? Swish.Utils.DateTime is now
  marked as deprecated since it isn't used by any other module.

- move to camel case for names, in particular for
  Swish.RDF.Vocabulary; this would require a minor version update

- change SwishAction from a tuple to a SwishStateIO (); requires an
  minor version update

  can we improve the processing of the commands, so that they
  exit on error immediately, with a single error message.

  An EDSL for the command language or for the base components
  such as RDFTriple/Graph?

- remove the containedIn function of the LDGraph type class,
  or implement it. It is currently unused in the code base.
